[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/goinstant/collaboration-bundle.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/goinstant/collaboration-bundle)

## [Collaboration Bundle](https://developers.goinstant.com/v1/widgets/collaboration_bundle.html)

The Collaboration Bundle collects the [GoInstant widgets](https://developers.goinstant.com/v1/widgets/index.html) together,
providing an easy-to-use, drop-in collaboration layer in any web site.

You can learn more in our
[guides](https://developers.goinstant.com/v1/widgets/guides/index.html),
and
[documentation](https://developers.goinstant.com/v1/widgets/collaboration_bundle.html).

Have questions? We're on IRC. #goinstant on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/).

## Packaging
For your convenience, we've packaged the Collaboration Bundle in several
ways.

#### Using our CDN

We host a copy on our CDN. Have a look at the [docs](https://developers.goinstant.com/v1/widgets/collaboration_bundle.html)
to see how to reference those files, as well as how to initialize the component.

#### How do I build the script myself?

You may have your own build process. We've tried to make it easy to include
the Collaboration Bundle in your build process.

#### Bower

We've packaged the Collaboration Bundle as a [bower](http://bower.io/)
component.

```
bower install collaboration-bundle
```

#### Component

We've packaged the Collaboration Bundle as a [component](http://component.io/).

```
component install collaboration-bundle
```

## Contributing

### Development Dependencies

- [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) >= 0.8.0
- [grunt-cli installed globally](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started)
  - `npm install -g grunt-cli`

### Set-Up

The following assumes that you have already installed the dependencies above.

```
git clone https://github.com/goinstant/collaboration-bundle.git
cd collaboration-bundle
npm install
```

#### Building Collaboration Bundle for Development

The Collaboration Bundle is built as a [component](https://github.com/component/component).
Feel free to manually install dependencies and build using the `component`
command line tool.

For convenience, we've included a simple grunt command for installing
component dependencies and building:

```
grunt build
```

If this command runs succesfully you'll now have `components` and `build`
directories in your Git repo root.

### Running Tests

Tests are written in [mocha](http://mochajs.org/). They're run
in an [HTML file](http://mochajs.org/#html).

Just open the test/index.html file to run the tests.

On Mac OS, you can just run this command to open the HTML Runner in your
default browser:

```
open test/index.html
```

### Running Example

This will open up an example of Collaboration Bundle at work, using your local
build.

You should have run `grunt build` already.

#### 1. Copy the example config.

```
cp config/config.example.js config/config.js
```

#### 2. Replace the connectUrl with your Platform application's.

If you haven't signed up for GoInstant yet, you can [sign up and create an
application here](https://goinstant.com/signup).

After you have an application's `connectUrl`, put it inside of config.js:

##### config.js

```js
window.CONFIG = {
  connectUrl: 'https://goinstant.net/YOUR_ACCOUNT/YOUR_APP'
};
```

#### 3. Open the example

```
open examples/example.html
```
